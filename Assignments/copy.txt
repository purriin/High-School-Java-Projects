A STUDY IN SCARLET.By A. Conan DoylePART I.(_Being a reprint from the reminiscences of_ JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., _lateof the Army Medical Department._) [2]CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of theUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the courseprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as AssistantSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and beforeI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing atBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, andwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with manyother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeededin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at onceentered upon my new duties.The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it hadnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade andattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle ofMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, whichshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should havefallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for thedevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across apack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I hadundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, tothe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improvedso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a littleupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curseof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, andwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak andemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lostin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in thetroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, withmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternalgovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free asair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day willpermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated toLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers ofthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time ata private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaninglessexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freelythan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, thatI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticatesomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration inmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by makingup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some lesspretentious and less expensive domicile.On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing atthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turninground I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me atBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London isa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had neverbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In theexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, andwe started off together in a hansom.“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked inundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded itby the time that we reached our destination.“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to mymisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problemas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonableprice.”“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second manto-day that has used that expression to me.”“And who was the first?” I asked.“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someoneto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and whichwere too much for his purse.”“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms andthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partnerto being alone.”Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “Youdon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not carefor him as a constant companion.”“Why, what is there against him?”“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queerin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as Iknow he is a decent fellow enough.”“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is wellup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies arevery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the wayknowledge which would astonish his professors.”“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can becommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, Ishould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strongenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both inAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. Howcould I meet this friend of yours?”“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He eitheravoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning tonight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into otherchannels.As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamfordgave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed totake as a fellow-lodger.“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I knownothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally inthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold meresponsible.”“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “Itseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that youhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’stemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh.“Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches tocold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch ofthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate ideaof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himselfwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite andexact knowledge.”“Very right too.”“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating thesubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly takingrather a bizarre shape.”“Beating the subjects!”“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw himat it with my own eyes.”“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here weare, and you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, weturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, whichopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase andmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashedwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passagebranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distanttable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced roundand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’vefound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with atest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitatedby hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,greater delight could not have shone upon his features.“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strengthfor which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been inAfghanistan, I perceive.”“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is abouthoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery ofmine?”“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “butpractically----”“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.Don’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Comeover here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, anddrew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us havesome fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, anddrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. “Now, Iadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive thatthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportionof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As hespoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then addedsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed adull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottomof the glass jar.“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as achild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy anduncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. Thelatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appearsto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test beeninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would longago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”“Indeed!” I murmured.“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man issuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. Hislinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the SherlockHolmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over hisheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by hisimagination.“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at hisenthusiasm.“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He wouldcertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there wasMason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,and Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which itwould have been decisive.”“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with alaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police Newsof the Past.’”“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked SherlockHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for Idabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, andI noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,and discoloured with strong acids.“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a highthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction withhis foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you werecomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thoughtthat I had better bring you together.”Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms withme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which wouldsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,I hope?”“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionallydo experiments. Would that annoy you?”“By no means.”“Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps attimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I amsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. Whathave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know theworst of one another before they begin to live together.”I laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “andI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sortsof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of viceswhen I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,anxiously.“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a treatfor the gods--a badly-played one----”“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we mayconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable toyou.”“When shall we see them?”“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settleeverything,” he answered.“All right--noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towardsmy hotel.“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, “howthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his littlepeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how hefinds things out.”“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant.I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study ofmankind is man,’ you know.”“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns moreabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerablyinterested in my new acquaintance.CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,[5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. Theyconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single largeairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broadwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderatedid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain wasconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on thefollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes andportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking andlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, wegradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our newsurroundings.Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quietin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to beup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone outbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemicallaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in longwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; butnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he wouldlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or movinga muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed sucha dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected himof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperanceand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to hisaims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person andappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casualobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessivelylean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp andpiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air ofalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squarenesswhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariablyblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed ofextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observewhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess howmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavouredto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concernedhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, howobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather wasexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me andbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, Ieagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, andspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.He was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,confirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear tohave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree inscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entranceinto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,and within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ampleand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no manwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had somedefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for theexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small mattersunless he has some very good reason for doing so.His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporaryliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who hemight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theoryand of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized humanbeing in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earthtravelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary factthat I could hardly realize it.“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression ofsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”“To forget it!”“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally islike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furnitureas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that hecomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him getscrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so thathe has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workmanis very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He willhave nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but ofthese he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. Itis a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and candistend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for everyaddition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It isof the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowingout the useful ones.”“But the Solar System!” I protested.“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you saythat we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make apennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but somethingin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. Ipondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to drawmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge whichdid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which hepossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my ownmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he wasexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ranin this way--SHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.  1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.  2.              Philosophy.--Nil.  3.              Astronomy.--Nil.  4.              Politics.--Feeble.  5.              Botany.--Variable.  Well up in belladonna,                              opium, and poisons generally.                              Knows nothing of practical gardening.  6.              Geology.--Practical, but limited.                               Tells at a glance different soils                               from each other.  After walks has                               shown me splashes upon his trousers,                               and told me by their colour and                               consistence in what part of London                               he had received them.  7.              Chemistry.--Profound.  8.              Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.  9.              Sensational Literature.--Immense.  He appears                              to know every detail of every horror                              perpetrated in the century.  10. Plays the violin well.  11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.  12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.“If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling allthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,” I said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”I see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. Thesewere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.That he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, becauseat my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and otherfavourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce anymusic or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair ofan evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddlewhich was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous andmelancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly theyreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aidedthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whimor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled againstthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated themby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as aslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to thinkthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,however, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the mostdifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who camethree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The sameafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jewpedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closelyfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an oldwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and onanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of thesenondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used tobeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.He always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I haveto use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these peopleare my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blankquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man toconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason fornot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round tothe subject of his own accord.It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that Irose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had notyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to mylate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. Withthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curtintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the tableand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munchedsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at theheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.Its somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted toshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematicexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being aremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning wasclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetchedand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitchof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man’s inmost thoughts.Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of onetrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallibleas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appearto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he hadarrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer thepossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard ofone or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which isknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquiredby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortalto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning tothose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatestdifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementaryproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance todistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession towhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens thefaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to lookfor. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by histrouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by hisexpression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man’s callingis plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten thecompetent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on thetable, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I satdown to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have markedit. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. Itis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all theseneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is notpractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third classcarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all hisfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.”“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As forthe article I wrote it myself.”“You!”“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. Thetheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be sochimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I dependupon them for my bread and cheese.”“And how?” I asked involuntarily.“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in theworld. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of privateones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage toput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and Iam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history ofcrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance aboutmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your fingerends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first. Lestradeis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over aforgery case, and that was what brought him here.”“And these other people?”“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They areall people who are in trouble about something, and want a littleenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, andthen I pocket my fee.”“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room youcan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although theyhave seen every detail for themselves?”“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a caseturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about andsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledgewhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused yourscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me issecond nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on ourfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”“You were told, no doubt.”“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From longhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that Iarrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.There were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is agentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearlyan army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face isdark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists arefair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face saysclearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff andunnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor haveseen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.’ Thewhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that youcame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remindme of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals didexist outside of stories.”Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you arecomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in myopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breakingin on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter ofan hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had someanalytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon asPoe appeared to imagine.”“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to youridea of a detective?”Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,” he said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him, andthat was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question washow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-fourhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book fordetectives to teach them what to avoid.”I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admiredtreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stoodlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” Isaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,querulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I knowwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or hasever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of naturaltalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is theresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainywith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can seethrough it.”I was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought itbest to change the topic.“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to astalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down theother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He hada large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of amessage.“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verifyhis guess.”The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we werewatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly acrossthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy stepsascending the stair.“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handingmy friend the letter.Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He littlethought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” Isaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at mycompanion.“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,sir.”He clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and wasgone.CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY [6]I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of thepractical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powersof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurkingsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arrangedepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could havein taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him hehad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,“Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhapsit is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was asergeant of Marines?”“No, indeed.”“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If youwere asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find somedifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across thestreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of thefellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He wasa man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swunghis cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face ofhim--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that hewas pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now thatthere were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!” Hethrew me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. [7]“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly.“Would you mind reading it to me aloud?”This is the letter which I read to him----“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,off the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two inthe morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that somethingwas amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bareof furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, andhaving cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch J. Drebber,Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is there anyevidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood inthe room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as tohow he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.If you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will findme there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and wouldesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.Yours faithfully,“TOBIAS GREGSON.”“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked;“he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick andenergetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knivesinto one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professionalbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both putupon the scent.”I was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there isnot a moment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazydevil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me,for I can be spry enough at times.”“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel thewhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. willpocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”“But he begs you to help him.”“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; buthe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on myown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”He hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed thatan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.“Get your hat,” he said.“You wish me to come?”“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both ina hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over thehouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streetsbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled awayabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius andan Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and themelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said atlast, interrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize beforeyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger;“this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very muchmistaken.”“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so fromit, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey uponfoot.Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It wasone of four which stood back some little way from the street, two beingoccupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacantmelancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here andthere a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the blearedpanes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sicklyplants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversedby a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of amixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from therain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by athree-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, andagainst this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded bya small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyesin the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into thehouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to befurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under thecircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged upand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, theopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,he proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grasswhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twicehe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamationof satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayeysoil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I wasunable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of hisperceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great dealwhich was hidden from me.At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward andwrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you tocome,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herdof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. Nodoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before youpermitted this.”“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective saidevasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon himto look after this.”Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With twosuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not bemuch for a third party to find out,” he said.Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have doneall that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and Iknew your taste for such things.”“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.“No, sir.”“Nor Lestrade?”“No, sir.”“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark hestrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressedhis astonishment.A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of thesehad obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to thedining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair hadoccurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feelingat my heart which the presence of death inspires.It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absenceof all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it wasblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips hadbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece ofimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of ared wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light washazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which wasintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.All these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention wascentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched uponthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discolouredceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years ofage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, anda short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coatand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collarand cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floorbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, whilehis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been agrievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon humanfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the lowforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularlysimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,unnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never hasit appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimyapartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburbanLondon.Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, andgreeted my companion and myself.“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything Ihave seen, and I am no chicken.”“There is no clue?” said Gregson.“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined itintently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing tonumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.“Positive!” cried both detectives.“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me ofthe circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, inthe year ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”“No, sir.”“Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. Ithas all been done before.”As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the samefar-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly wasthe examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minutenesswith which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man’s lips,and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing moreto be learned.”Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they enteredthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raisedhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbedit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”He held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gatheredround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet ofplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they werecomplicated enough before.”“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’snothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in hispockets?”“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objectsupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163, byBarraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog’s head, with rubies as eyes.Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loosemoney to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition ofBoccaccio’s ‘Decameron,’ with name of Joseph Stangerson upon thefly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to JosephStangerson.”“At what address?”“American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are bothfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of theirboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about toreturn to New York.”“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisementssent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the AmericanExchange, but he has not returned yet.”“Have you sent to Cleveland?”“We telegraphed this morning.”“How did you word your inquiries?”“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be gladof any information which could help us.”“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you tobe crucial?”“I asked about Stangerson.”“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appearsto hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to makesome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while wewere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highestimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made acareful examination of the walls.”The little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently ina state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against hiscolleague.“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere ofwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, standthere!”He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In thisparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving ayellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there wasscrawled in blood-red letters a single word--                         RACHE.“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of ashowman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in thedarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. Themurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear whereit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicideanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. Seethat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it waslit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion ofthe wall.”“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in adepreciatory voice.“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female nameRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You markmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that awoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well foryou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, butthe old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled thelittle man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “Youcertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the otherparticipant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to examine thisroom yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”As he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifyingglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselesslyabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and oncelying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation thathe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away tohimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fireof exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive ofencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly remindedof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards andforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comesacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued hisresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance betweenmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying histape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one placehe gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,and packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glassthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the mostminute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for hereplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” heremarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply todetective work.”Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateurcompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidentlyfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, thatSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards somedefinite and practical end.“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presumeto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that itwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world ofsarcasm in his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how yourinvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any helpI can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who foundthe body. Can you give me his name and address?”Lestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is offduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”Holmes took a note of the address.“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tellyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning tothe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was aman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, hadsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked aTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on hisoff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and thefinger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only afew indications, but they may assist you.”Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other thing,Lestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the Germanfor ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivalsopen-mouthed behind him.CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.IT was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. SherlockHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched along telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take usto the address given us by Lestrade.“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matterof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may aswell learn all that is to be learned.”“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as youpretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thingwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts withits wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rainfor a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression musthave been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’shoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut thanthat of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cabwas there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during themorning--I have Gregson’s word for that--it follows that it must havebeen there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those twoindividuals to the house.”“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’sheight?”“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told fromthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, thoughthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s strideboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way ofchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leadshim to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was justover six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”“And his age?” I asked.“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallesteffort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadthof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.There is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinarylife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which Iadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped inblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightlyscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’snail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by aTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, Ihave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I candistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigaror of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detectivediffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”“And the florid face?” I asked.“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I wasright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”I passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked; “themore one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these twomen--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of thecabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring there? Aboveall, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE beforedecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconcilingall these facts.”My companion smiled approvingly.“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” hesaid. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made upmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simplya blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggestingSocialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, ifyou noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a realGerman invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safelysay that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator whooverdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrongchannel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. Youknow a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to theconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as nearan exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest wayin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitiveto flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent leathers [10] andSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathwaytogether as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. Icould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked hegrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of hisstrides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know myselfnow, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good workingbasis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go toHalle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its waythrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In thedingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.“That’s Audley Court in there,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit inthe line of dead-coloured brick. “You’ll find me here when you comeback.”Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led usinto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. Wepicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines ofdiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of whichwas decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance wasengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we wereshown into a little front parlour to await his coming.He appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed inhis slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with itpensively. “We thought that we should like to hear it all from your ownlips,” he said.“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constableanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as thoughdetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten atnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘WhiteHart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock itbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grovebeat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would takea look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It wasprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, whensuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that samehouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was emptyon account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoidfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light inthe window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to thedoor----”“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companioninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmostamazement upon his features.“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still andso lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with me.I ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I thoughtthat maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the drainswhat killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I walked backto the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but there wasn’t nosign of him nor of anyone else.”“There was no one in the street?”“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myselftogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was acandle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light Isaw----”“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and triedthe kitchen door, and then----”John Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion inhis eyes. “Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to methat you knows a deal more than you should.”Holmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.“Don’t get arresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of thehounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer forthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?”Rance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.“I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcherand two more to the spot.”“Was the street empty then?”“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”“What do you mean?”The constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunkchap in my time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk asthat cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin therailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’sNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far lesshelp.”“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He wasan uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in thestation if we hadn’t been so took up.”“His face--his dress--didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke inimpatiently.“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up--meand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lowerpart muffled round----”“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in anaggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”“How was he dressed?”“A brown overcoat.”“Had he a whip in his hand?”“A whip--no.”“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t happento see or hear a cab after that?”“No.”“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up andtaking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in theforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. Youmight have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom youheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, andwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell youthat it is so. Come along, Doctor.”We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,but obviously uncomfortable.“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to ourlodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of goodluck, and not taking advantage of it.”“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of thisman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But whyshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the wayof criminals.”“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have noother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. Ishall have him, Doctor--I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I mustthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so havemissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh?Why shouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread ofmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty isto unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And nowfor lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowingare splendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays somagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”Leaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like alark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.OUR morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I wastired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, Ilay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all thathad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded intoit. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distortedbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was theimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found itdifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed itsowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the mostmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, ofCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that thedepravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’shypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how hehad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected somethingwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, whathad caused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks ofstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay sothickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had thevictim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. Aslong as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would beno easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confidentmanner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explainedall the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.He was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concertcould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table beforehe appeared.“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you rememberwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing andappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power ofspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influencedby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centurieswhen the world was in its childhood.”“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpretNature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quiteyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardenedafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces atMaiwand without losing my nerve.”“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates theimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have youseen the evening paper?”“No.”“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention thefact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell uponthe floor. It is just as well it does not.”“Why?”“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to everypaper this morning immediately after the affair.”He threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. Itwas the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,this morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadwaybetween the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of thesedunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I haveno ring.”“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well. Itis almost a facsimile.”“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”“Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.If he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reasonto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose thering. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber’sbody, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house hediscovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already inpossession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He hadto pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might havebeen aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in thatman’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to himthat it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leavingthe house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for theevening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. Hiseye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why shouldhe fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the findingof the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He willcome. You shall see him within an hour?”“And then?” I asked.“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man,and though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready foranything.”I went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned withthe pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in hisfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answerto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”“And that is?” I asked eagerly.“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put yourpistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinaryway. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him toohard.”“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.That will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is aqueer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--‘De Jure interGentes’--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’head was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backedvolume was struck off.”“Who is the printer?”“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in veryfaded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who WilliamWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. Hiswriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rosesoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard theservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as sheopened it.“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. Wecould not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some onebegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shufflingone. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as helistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feebletap at the door.“Come in,” I cried.At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a veryold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to bedazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, shestood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocketwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his facehad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do tokeep my countenance.The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at ouradvertisement. “It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said,dropping another curtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. Itbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,which her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say ifhe come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, hebeing short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when hehas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night alongwith----”“Is that her ring?” I asked.“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad womanthis night. That’s the ring.”“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,” saidSherlock Holmes sharply.The old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her littlered-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”“And your name is----?”“My name is Sawyer--her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--anda smart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in thecompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and whatwith liquor shops----”“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a signfrom my companion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am gladto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.”With many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old cronepacked it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. SherlockHolmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed intohis room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster anda cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he said, hurriedly; “she must be anaccomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.” The hall door hadhardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair.Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along theother side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.“Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself, “or else hewill be led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no need for himto ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible untilI heard the result of his adventure.It was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he mightbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pagesof Henri Murger’s “Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard thefootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and themore stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the samedestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound ofhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had notbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for themastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into ahearty laugh.“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,dropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they wouldnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because Iknow that I will be even with them in the long run.”“What is it then?” I asked.“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature hadgone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of beingfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler whichwas passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, butI need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough tobe heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13, Duncan Street,Houndsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, andhaving seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That’s an artwhich every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, andnever drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped offbefore we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy,lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I sawhim open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. WhenI reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, andgiving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever Ilistened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear itwill be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, namedKeswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had everbeen heard of there.”“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering,feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,without either you or the driver seeing her?”“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the oldwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and anactive one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up wasinimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this meansof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not aslonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risksomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my adviceand turn in.”I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. Ileft Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into thewatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin,and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which hehad set himself to unravel.CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.THE papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termedit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon itin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. Istill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearingupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there hadseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The Germanname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinisterinscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by politicalrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches inAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,and been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwiniantheory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, thearticle concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closerwatch over foreigners in England.The _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sortusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from theunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakeningof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who hadbeen residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at theboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. JosephStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention ofcatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together uponthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s bodywas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, arequestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of thewhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade andMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and itis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedilythrow light upon the matter.The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime beinga political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animatedthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shoresa number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they notsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among thesemen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which waspunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of thedeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the addressof the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due tothe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, andthey appeared to afford him considerable amusement.“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sureto score.”“That depends on how it turns out.”“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught, itwill be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _inspite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose. Whateverthey do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un plus sotqui l’admire.’”“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came thepattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied byaudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said mycompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half adozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clappedeyes on.“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty littlescoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “Infuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of youmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?”“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here areyour wages.” [13] He handed each of them a shilling.“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats,and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars thanout of a dozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of anofficial-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, goeverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; allthey want is organisation.”“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matterof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon everyfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There heis!”There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds thefair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, andburst into our sitting-room.“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand,“congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive face.“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”“And his name is?”“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” criedGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious toknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendousexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have wornme out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain uponthe mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are bothbrain-workers.”“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how youarrived at this most gratifying result.”The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacentlyat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm ofamusement.“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinkshimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He isafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crimethan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by thistime.”The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.“And how did you get your clue?”“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this isstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contendwith was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some people wouldhave waited until their advertisements were answered, or until partiescame forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson’sway of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?”“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”Gregson looked quite crest-fallen.“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”“No.”“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect achance, however small it may seem.”“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of thatsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.He had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s BoardingEstablishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”“Smart--very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective.“I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,too--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red aboutthe eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escapemy notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. SherlockHolmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in yournerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr.Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughterburst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew somethingof the matter.“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ Iasked.“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down heragitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were twotrains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. [14]“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.Her features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before shecould get out the single word ‘Yes’--and when it did come it was in ahusky unnatural tone.“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calmclear voice.“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us befrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.’“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands andsinking back in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answeredfirmly.“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences areworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to me,‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalfof my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in thisterrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to becompromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, hisprofession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and herdaughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention oftelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it Ihave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you allwithout omitting any particular.’“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary,Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a“Copenhagen” label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had beentheir last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but hisemployer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in hishabits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he becamevery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o’clock in theday he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards themaid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, hespeedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoketo her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocentto understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms andembraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach himfor his unmanly conduct.’“‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can getrid of your boarders when you wish.’“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God thatI had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘Butit was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteenpounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy inthe Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for thebest. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave onaccount of it. That was the reason of his going.’“‘Well?’“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leavejust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temperis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed thedoor behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, inless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse fordrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with mydaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her thatshe should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there is no lawto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girlhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like aprincess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards thedoor. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused soundsof a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look upI saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.“I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,” he said. “I willjust go after him and see what he does with himself.” With those wordshe took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning weheard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps andpauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. Imade shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there shouldbe no possibility of a mistake.”“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What happenednext?”“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that thewhole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way whichI always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her sonreturned.“‘I do not know,’ she answered.“‘Not know?’“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’“‘After you went to bed?’“‘Yes.’“‘When did you go to bed?’“‘About eleven.’“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’“‘Yes.’“‘Possibly four or five?’“‘Yes.’“‘What was he doing during that time?’“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I foundout where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, andarrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to comequietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose youare arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrelDrebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that hisalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”“Very,” said Holmes.“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him ashaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”“What is your theory, then?”“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course ofwhich Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was sowet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victiminto the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writingon the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw thepolice on to the wrong scent.”“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, youare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.”“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detectiveanswered proudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which hesaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,and took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met anold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where thisold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. Ithink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is tothink of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraidhe won’t make much of [15] Why, by Jove, here’s the very man himself!”It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we weretalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntinesswhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarrangedand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consultingwith Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to beembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumblingnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a mostextraordinary case,” he said at last--“a most incomprehensible affair.”“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “Ithought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find theSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?”“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “wasmurdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”CHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and sounexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprangout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. Istared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and hisbrows drawn down over his eyes.“Stangerson too!” he muttered. “The plot thickens.”“It was quite thick enough before,” grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.“I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.”“Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?” stammeredGregson.“I have just come from his room,” said Lestrade. “I was the first todiscover what had occurred.”“We have been hearing Gregson’s view of the matter,” Holmes observed.“Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?”“I have no objection,” Lestrade answered, seating himself. “I freelyconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned inthe death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I wascompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find outwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at EustonStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in themorning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question whichconfronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warningthem to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work callingupon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. Yousee, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in thevicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again nextmorning.”“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,” remarked Holmes.“So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in makingenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, andat eight o’clock I reached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little GeorgeStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,they at once answered me in the affirmative.“‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘Hehas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’“‘Where is he now?’ I asked.“‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’“‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.“It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves andlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show methe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridorleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about togo downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, inspite of my twenty years’ experience. From under the door there curleda little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage andformed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The doorwas locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked itin. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddledup, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and hadbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turnedhim over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentlemanwho had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The causeof death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetratedthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do yousuppose was above the murdered man?”I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,even before Sherlock Holmes answered.“The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,” he said.“That was it,” said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were allsilent for a while.There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about thedeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness tohis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battletingled as I thought of it.“The man was seen,” continued Lestrade. “A milk boy, passing on his wayto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mewsat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually laythere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, whichwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend theladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him tobe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particularnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for himto be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddishface, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed inthe room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stainedwater in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on thesheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.”I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, whichtallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace ofexultation or satisfaction upon his face.“Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to themurderer?” he asked.“Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket, but it seemsthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty oddpounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of theseextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There wereno papers or memoranda in the murdered man’s pocket, except a singletelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containingthe words, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to thismessage.”“And there was nothing else?” Holmes asked.“Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had readhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chairbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on thewindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.”Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.“The last link,” he cried, exultantly. “My case is complete.”The two detectives stared at him in amazement.“I have now in my hands,” my companion said, confidently, “all thethreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, detailsto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from thetime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to thediscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my owneyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your handupon those pills?”“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box; “I took themand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place ofsafety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking thesepills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance tothem.”“Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are thoseordinary pills?”They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,round, and almost transparent against the light. “From their lightnessand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,” Iremarked.“Precisely so,” answered Holmes. “Now would you mind going down andfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.”I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It’s labouredbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceededthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on therug.“I will now cut one of these pills in two,” said Holmes, and drawing hispenknife he suited the action to the word. “One half we return into thebox for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,in which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, theDoctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.”“This may be very interesting,” said Lestrade, in the injured tone ofone who suspects that he is being laughed at, “I cannot see, however,what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.”“Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it haseverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make themixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he lapsit up readily enough.”As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer andplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. SherlockHolmes’ earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat insilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startlingeffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretchedupon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparentlyneither the better nor the worse for its draught.Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute withoutresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appearedupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon thetable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So greatwas his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the twodetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check whichhe had met.“It can’t be a coincidence,” he cried, at last springing from his chairand pacing wildly up and down the room; “it is impossible that it shouldbe a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case ofDrebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet theyare inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannothave been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none theworse. Ah, I have it! I have it!” With a perfect shriek of delight herushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,and presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature’s tongueseemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsiveshiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had beenstruck by lightning.Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from hisforehead. “I should have more faith,” he said; “I ought to know bythis time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train ofdeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some otherinterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadlypoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known thatbefore ever I saw the box at all.”This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I couldhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,however, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to methat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I beganto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.“All this seems strange to you,” continued Holmes, “because you failedat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the singlereal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seizeupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served toconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequenceof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case moreobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The mostcommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents nonew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murderwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body ofthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any ofthose _outré_ and sensational accompaniments which have renderedit remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case moredifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.”Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerableimpatience, could contain himself no longer. “Look here, Mr. SherlockHolmes,” he said, “we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smartman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want somethingmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of takingthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. YoungCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestradewent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know morethan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right toask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name theman who did it?”“I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,” remarked Lestrade.“We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked morethan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidencewhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.”“Any delay in arresting the assassin,” I observed, “might give him timeto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.”Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. Hecontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chestand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.“There will be no more murders,” he said at last, stopping abruptly andfacing us. “You can put that consideration out of the question. You haveasked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing ofhis name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of layingour hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopesof managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing whichneeds delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to dealwith, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another whois as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyonecan have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had theslightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instantamong the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaningto hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider thesemen to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why Ihave not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur allthe blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At presentI am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with youwithout endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.”Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former hadflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady eyesglistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time tospeak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesmanof the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant andunsavoury person.“Please, sir,” he said, touching his forelock, “I have the cabdownstairs.”“Good boy,” said Holmes, blandly. “Why don’t you introduce this patternat Scotland Yard?” he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs froma drawer. “See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in aninstant.”“The old pattern is good enough,” remarked Lestrade, “if we can onlyfind the man to put them on.”“Very good, very good,” said Holmes, smiling. “The cabman may as wellhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.”I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were aboutto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out andbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered theroom.“Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,” he said, kneeling overhis task, and never turning his head.The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and putdown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, thejangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.“Gentlemen,” he cried, with flashing eyes, “let me introduce you to Mr.Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.”The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no timeto realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes’triumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’sdazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which hadappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we mighthave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes’s grasp, and hurledhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; butbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang uponhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and thencommenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, thatthe four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have theconvulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and handswere terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss ofblood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not untilLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth andhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were ofno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned hisfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless andpanting.“We have his cab,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It will serve to take him toScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,” he continued, with a pleasant smile,“we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome toput any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that Iwill refuse to answer them.”PART II. _The Country of the Saints._CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there liesan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as abarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada toNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Coloradoupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Naturealways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprisessnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There areswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there areenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer aregrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the commoncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawneesor of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach otherhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sightof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon theirprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavilythrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the darkravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. Theseare the sole dwellers in the wilderness.In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that fromthe northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reachstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches ofalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. Onthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,with their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch ofcountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing butsilence--complete and heart-subduing silence.It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broadplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, onesees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and islost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden downby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scatteredwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dulldeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: somelarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former havebelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles onemay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of thosewho had fallen by the wayside.Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearancewas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearerto forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brownparchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; hislong, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; hiseyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; whilethe hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of askeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yethis tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiryand vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what itwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man wasdying--dying from hunger and from thirst.He had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this littleelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the greatsalt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savagemountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which mightindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape therewas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wildquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come toan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. “Whynot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,” he muttered,as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.Before sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carriedslung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy forhis strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with somelittle violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a littlemoaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with verybright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.“You’ve hurt me!” said a childish voice reproachfully.“Have I though,” the man answered penitently, “I didn’t go for to doit.” As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a prettylittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smartpink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. Thechild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that shehad suffered less than her companion.“How is it now?” he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing thetowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.“Kiss it and make it well,” she said, with perfect gravity, shoving[19] the injured part up to him. “That’s what mother used to do. Where’smother?”“Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.”“Gone, eh!” said the little girl. “Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she‘most always did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and nowshe’s been away three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t thereno water, nor nothing to eat?”“No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient awhile,and then you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, andthen you’ll feel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your lips is likeleather, but I guess I’d best let you know how the cards lie. What’sthat you’ve got?”“Pretty things! fine things!” cried the little girl enthusiastically,holding up two glittering fragments of mica. “When we goes back to homeI’ll give them to brother Bob.”“You’ll see prettier things than them soon,” said the man confidently.“You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember whenwe left the river?”“Oh, yes.”“Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But therewas somethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’tturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of youand--and----”“And you couldn’t wash yourself,” interrupted his companion gravely,staring up at his grimy visage.“No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then IndianPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,your mother.”“Then mother’s a deader too,” cried the little girl dropping her face inher pinafore and sobbing bitterly.“Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was somechance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder andwe tramped it together. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters.There’s an almighty small chance for us now!”“Do you mean that we are going to die too?” asked the child, checkingher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.“I guess that’s about the size of it.”“Why didn’t you say so before?” she said, laughing gleefully. “You gaveme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be withmother again.”“Yes, you will, dearie.”“And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet shemeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lotof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me wasfond of. How long will it be first?”“I don’t know--not very long.” The man’s eyes were fixed upon thenorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appearedthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly didthey approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brownbirds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and thensettled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, thevultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.“Cocks and hens,” cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at theirill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. “Say, didGod make this country?”“In course He did,” said her companion, rather startled by thisunexpected question.“He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,” thelittle girl continued. “I guess somebody else made the country in theseparts. It’s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and thetrees.”“What would ye think of offering up prayer?” the man asked diffidently.“It ain’t night yet,” she answered.“It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, youbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in thewaggon when we was on the Plains.”“Why don’t you say some yourself?” the child asked, with wondering eyes.“I disremember them,” he answered. “I hain’t said none since I was halfthe height o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out,and I’ll stand by and come in on the choruses.”“Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,” she said, laying the shawlout for that purpose. “You’ve got to put your hands up like this. Itmakes you feel kind o’ good.”It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to seeit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the littleprattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,and his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudlessheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they wereface to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the otherdeep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. Theprayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulderuntil the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of herprotector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature provedto be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowedhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over thetired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until theman’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sightwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkaliplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, andhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but graduallygrowing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud.This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that itcould only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In morefertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that oneof those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land wasapproaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. Asthe whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the twocastaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and thefigures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and theapparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey forthe West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the baseof the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Rightacross the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggonsand carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women whostaggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside thewaggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidentlyno ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who hadbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a newcountry. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering andrumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheelsand the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient torouse the two tired wayfarers above them.At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfacedmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reachingthe base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council amongthemselves.“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped,clean-shaven man with grizzly hair.“To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,” said another.“Fear not for water,” cried a third. “He who could draw it from therocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.”“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest andkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged cragabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sightthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, whilefresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word‘Redskins’ was on every lip.“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man whoappeared to be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are noother tribes until we cross the great mountains.”“Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,” asked one of the band.“And I,” “and I,” cried a dozen voices.“Leave your horses below and we will await you here,” the Elderanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened theirhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to theobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly andnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rockuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who hadfirst given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw himthrow up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joininghim they were affected in the same way by the sight which met theireyes.On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood asingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placidface and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside himlay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brownsinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of hisvelveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line ofsnow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantilefeatures. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks andneat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the longshrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above thisstrange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight ofthe new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flappedsullenly away.The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20]them in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down uponthe plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, andwhich was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. Hisface assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed hisboney hand over his eyes. “This is what they call delirium, I guess,” he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt ofhis coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wonderingquestioning gaze of childhood.The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways thattheir appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl,and hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gauntcompanion, and assisted him towards the waggons.“My name is John Ferrier,” the wanderer explained; “me and that littleun are all that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’thirst and hunger away down in the south.”“Is she your child?” asked someone.“I guess she is now,” the other cried, defiantly; “she’s mine ‘cause Isaved her. No man will take her from me. She’s Lucy Ferrier from thisday on. Who are you, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity athis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; “there seems to be a powerful lot ofye.”“Nigh upon ten thousand,” said one of the young men; “we are thepersecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.”“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to havechosen a fair crowd of ye.”“Do not jest at that which is sacred,” said the other sternly. “We areof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letterson plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smithat Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where wehad founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violentman and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.”The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. “Isee,” he said, “you are the Mormons.”“We are the Mormons,” answered his companions with one voice.“And where are you going?”“We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of ourProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done withyou.”They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surroundedby crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women, stronglaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the criesof astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when theyperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of theother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed bya great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which wasconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness ofits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others werefurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver theresat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, butwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. Hewas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laidit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then heturned to the two castaways.“If we take you with us,” he said, in solemn words, “it can only be asbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Betterfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that youshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts thewhole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?”“Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,” said Ferrier, with suchemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leaderalone retained his stern, impressive expression.“Take him, Brother Stangerson,” he said, “give him food and drink,and the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holycreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”“On, on to Zion!” cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled downthe long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in adull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creakingof wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravanwas winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifshad been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was alreadyawaiting them.“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have recoveredfrom your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever youare of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken withthe voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.”CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations enduredby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From theshores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountainsthey had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, anddisease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had allbeen overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and theaccumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayerwhen they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneaththem, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was thepromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs forevermore.Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as aresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the futurecity was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted inproportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was putto his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets andsquares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was drainingand hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the wholecountry golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strangesettlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in thecentre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush ofdawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammerand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which theimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared hisfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormonsto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was bornealong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat whichshe shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrongforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,from the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became a petwith the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her movingcanvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from hisprivations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigablehunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, thatwhen they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreedthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of landas any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and ofStangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principalElders.On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantiallog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that itgrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,keen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitutionenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling hislands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged tohim prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than hisneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelvethere were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who couldcompare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant WahsatchMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.There was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilitiesof his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce himto set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. Henever gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself byresolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were somewho accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others whoput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl whohad pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformedto the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being anorthodox and straight-walking man.Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adoptedfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and thebalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother tothe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,her cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer uponthe high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughtsrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure trippingthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang,and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her fatherthe richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of Americangirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child haddeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysteriouschange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least ofall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or thetouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature hasawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and rememberthe one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In thecase of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apartfrom its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy asthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields andin the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty highroads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to thewest, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the OverlandRoute lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves ofsheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trainsof tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminablejourney. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with theskill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fairface flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating outbehind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and wasdashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessnessof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. Thetravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and eventhe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed theiraccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-facedmaiden.She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the roadblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-lookingherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass thisobstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcelyhad she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behindher, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream offierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal withcattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage ofevery opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her waythrough the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank ofthe mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up uponits hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way thatwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was fullof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the hornsagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl coulddo to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible deathunder the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed tosudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridleto relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from thestruggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,but for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. Atthe same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse bythe curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to theoutskirts.“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.She looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awfulfrightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Ponchowould have been so scared by a lot of cows?”“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a tall,savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, andclad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over hisshoulders. “I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he remarked,“I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if heremembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he’s the same Ferrier, myfather and he were pretty thick.”“Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely.The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyessparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in themountains for two months, and are not over and above in visitingcondition. He must take us as he finds us.”“He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered,“he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have nevergot over it.”“Neither would I,” said her companion.“You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.You ain’t even a friend of ours.”The young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that LucyFerrier laughed aloud.“There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend now.You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t trustme with his business any more. Good-bye!”“Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending overher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with herriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud ofdust.Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.He and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capitalenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keenas any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawnhis thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl,as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic,untamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight,he realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silverspeculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance tohim as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up inhis heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather thewild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. Hehad been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore inhis heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and humanperseverance could render him successful.He called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, untilhis face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in thevalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learningthe news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All thisJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interestedLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, andcould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lostin those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, asilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to behad, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became afavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. Onsuch occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longerher own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won heraffections.It was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulledup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. Hethrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.“I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazingtenderly down into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, butwill you be ready to come when I am here again?”“And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing.“A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, mydarling. There’s no one who can stand between us.”“And how about father?” she asked.“He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working allright. I have no fear on that head.”“Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’sno more to be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broadbreast.“Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It issettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They arewaiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye. In twomonths you shall see me.”He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon hishorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as thoughafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance atwhat he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him untilhe vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, thehappiest girl in all Utah.CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.THREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades haddeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier’s heart was sore within himwhen he thought of the young man’s return, and of the impending loss ofhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him tothe arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had alwaysdetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would everinduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage heregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whateverhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he wasinflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for toexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days inthe Land of the Saints.Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly daredonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest somethingwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down aswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turnedpersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the mostterrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the GermanVehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to puta more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud overthe State of Utah.Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, madethis organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient andomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held outagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone orwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,but no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at thehands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followedby annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of thisterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that menwent about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of thewilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon therecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwardsto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. Thesupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a femalepopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strangerumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants andrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh womenappeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, andbore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belatedwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. Thesetales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated andre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the DaniteBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terribleresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which itinspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthlesssociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood andviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to theProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth atnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence everyman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which werenearest his heart.One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,when he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. Hisheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great BrighamYoung himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit bodedhim little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. Thelatter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him witha stern face into the sitting-room.“Brother Ferrier,” he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenlyfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, “the true believers have beengood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in thedesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under ourprotection. Is not this so?”“It is so,” answered John Ferrier.“In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that youshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you haveneglected.”“And how have I neglected it?” asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands inexpostulation. “Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attendedat the Temple? Have I not----?”“Where are your wives?” asked Young, looking round him. “Call them in,that I may greet them.”“It is true that I have not married,” Ferrier answered. “But womenwere few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not alonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.”“It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,” said the leaderof the Mormons. “She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has foundfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.”John Ferrier groaned internally.“There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories thatshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?‘Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for ifshe wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.’ This being so, it isimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer yourdaughter to violate it.”John Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with hisriding-whip.“Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has beendecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we wouldnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of allchoice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must alsobe provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either ofthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choosebetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What sayyou to that?”Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.“You will give us time,” he said at last. “My daughter is veryyoung--she is scarce of an age to marry.”“She shall have a month to choose,” said Young, rising from his seat.“At the end of that time she shall give her answer.”He was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face andflashing eyes. “It were better for you, John Ferrier,” he thundered,“that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the SierraBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders ofthe Holy Four!”With a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, andFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.He was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how heshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid uponhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at herpale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.“I could not help it,” she said, in answer to his look. “His voice rangthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?”“Don’t you scare yourself,” he answered, drawing her to him, and passinghis broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. “We’ll fix itup somehow or another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’ lessening forthis chap, do you?”A sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.“No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s alikely lad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, inspite o’ all their praying and preaching. There’s a party starting forNevada to-morrow, and I’ll manage to send him a message letting him knowthe hole we are in. If I know anything o’ that young man, he’ll be backhere with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.”Lucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.“When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you thatI am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories aboutthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens tothem.”“But we haven’t opposed him yet,” her father answered. “It will be timeto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; atthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.”“Leave Utah!”“That’s about the size of it.”“But the farm?”“We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tellthe truth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. Idon’t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to theirdarned prophet. I’m a free-born American, and it’s all new to me. GuessI’m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he mightchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the oppositedirection.”“But they won’t let us leave,” his daughter objected.“Wait till Jefferson comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the meantime,don’t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes swelled up,else he’ll be walking into me when he sees you. There’s nothing to beafeared about, and there’s no danger at all.”John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,but she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to thefastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned andloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.ON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found hisacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted himwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of theimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that heshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returnedhome with a lighter heart.As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched toeach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on enteringto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with along pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feetcocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarsebloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands inhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier ashe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.“Maybe you don’t know us,” he said. “This here is the son of ElderDrebber, and I’m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desertwhen the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the truefold.”“As He will all the nations in His own good time,” said the other in anasal voice; “He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.”John Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.“We have come,” continued Stangerson, “at the advice of our fathers tosolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good toyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here hasseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.”“Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,” cried the other; “the question is nothow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has nowgiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.”“But my prospects are better,” said the other, warmly. “When theLord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leatherfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.”“It will be for the maiden to decide,” rejoined young Drebber, smirkingat his own reflection in the glass. “We will leave it all to herdecision.”During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.“Look here,” he said at last, striding up to them, “when my daughtersummons you, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your facesagain.”The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes thiscompetition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest ofhonours both to her and her father.“There are two ways out of the room,” cried Ferrier; “there is the door,and there is the window. Which do you care to use?”His brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,that his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. Theold farmer followed them to the door.“Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,” he said,sardonically.“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage. “You havedefied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the endof your days.”“The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,” cried young Drebber; “Hewill arise and smite you!”“Then I’ll start the smiting,” exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and wouldhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm andrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’hoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.“The young canting rascals!” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration fromhis forehead; “I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than thewife of either of them.”“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jeffersonwill soon be here.”“Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for wedo not know what their next move may be.”It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice andhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopteddaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never beensuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. Ifminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of thisarch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of noavail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had beenspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. Hewas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors whichhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, butthis suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance fromYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in anunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just overhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--“Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----”The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. Howthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for hisservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all beensecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, butthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days wereevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. Whatstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with suchmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struckhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to theirbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In thecentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did notenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch andward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 hadbeen painted upon the outside of his door.Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that hisunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in someconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of themonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placardsstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance JohnFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. Ahorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight ofthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled lookof some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that wasfor the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no newsof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still therecame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or adriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinkingthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way tofour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope ofescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountainswhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. Themore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none couldpass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way hewould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itselfbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s dishonour.He was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, andsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown thefigure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the lastof the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague andterrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was tobecome of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisiblenetwork which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the tableand sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door ofthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. Therewas a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound wasrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of thepanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carryout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agentwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrierfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shookhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt andthrew the door open.Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars weretwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before thefarmer’s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor onthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrierlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down athis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his faceupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall withhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His firstthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dyingman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into thehall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within thehouse the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to theastonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of JeffersonHope.“Good God!” gasped John Ferrier. “How you scared me! Whatever made youcome in like that.”“Give me food,” the other said, hoarsely. “I have had no time for biteor sup for eight-and-forty hours.” He flung himself upon the [21] coldmeat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host’ssupper, and devoured it voraciously. “Does Lucy bear up well?” he asked,when he had satisfied his hunger.“Yes. She does not know the danger,” her father answered.“That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawledmy way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not quite sharpenough to catch a Washoe hunter.”John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he hada devoted ally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung itcordially. “You’re a man to be proud of,” he said. “There are not manywho would come to share our danger and our troubles.”“You’ve hit it there, pard,” the young hunter answered. “I have arespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twicebefore I put my head into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings mehere, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o’ theHope family in Utah.”“What are we to do?”“To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much moneyhave you?”“Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.”“That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for CarsonCity through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well thatthe servants do not sleep in the house.”While Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approachingjourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find intoa small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew byexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He hadhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with hisdaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between thelovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there wasmuch to be done.“We must make our start at once,” said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a lowbut resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,but has steeled his heart to meet it. “The front and back entrances arewatched, but with caution we may get away through the side window andacross the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from theRavine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-waythrough the mountains.”“What if we are stopped,” asked Ferrier.Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of histunic. “If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of themwith us,” he said with a sinister smile.The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from thedarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,and which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nervedhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour andhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broadsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize thatthe spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and setexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the househe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scantyprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a fewof her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly andcarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured thenight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. Withbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gainedthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gapwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point whenthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into theshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.It was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope theears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before themelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yardsof them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a smalldistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from thegap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cryagain, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.“To-morrow at midnight,” said the first who appeared to be in authority.“When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.”“It is well,” returned the other. “Shall I tell Brother Drebber?”“Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!”“Seven to five!” repeated the other, and the two figures flitted awayin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been someform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had diedaway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping hiscompanions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the topof his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strengthappeared to fail her.“Hurry on! hurry on!” he gasped from time to time. “We are through theline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!”Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did theymeet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoidrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into arugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jaggedpeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which ledbetween them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting them.With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the greatboulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came tothe retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals hadbeen picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier uponone of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led theother along the precipitous and dangerous path.It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to faceNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up athousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basalticcolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advanceimpossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in placesthat they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practisedriders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers anddifficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,for every step increased the distance between them and the terribledespotism from which they were flying.They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within thejurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and mostdesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, andpointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out darkand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw themas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of “Who goesthere?” rang through the silent ravine.“Travellers for Nevada,” said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon therifle which hung by his saddle.They could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down atthem as if dissatisfied at their reply.“By whose permission?” he asked.“The Holy Four,” answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught himthat that was the highest authority to which he could refer.“Nine from seven,” cried the sentinel.“Seven from five,” returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering thecountersign which he had heard in the garden.“Pass, and the Lord go with you,” said the voice from above. Beyond hispost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into atrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning uponhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosenpeople, and that freedom lay before them.CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS.ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregularand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’sintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the trackonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savagebeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peakshemmed them in, peeping over each other’s shoulders to the far horizon.So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larchand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only agust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirelyan illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees andboulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which wokethe echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into agallop.As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the greatmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, untilthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered thehearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wildtorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered theirhorses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her fatherwould fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. “Theywill be upon our track by this time,” he said. “Everything depends uponour speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of ourlives.”During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, andby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles fromtheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and therehuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Beforedaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They hadseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think thatthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whoseenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp couldreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty storeof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he hadfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches andmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, forthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the airwas bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whateverchance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and theyoung girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animalsstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid themfrom his view.He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another withoutsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and otherindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.At last, after two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was thinking ofturning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sightwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of ajutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood acreature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with apair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had notperceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, andtook a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal spranginto the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, andthen came crashing down into the valley beneath.The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himselfwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophyover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening wasalready drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realizedthe difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered farpast the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matterto pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he foundhimself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so likeeach other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrentwhich he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he hadtaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Nightwas coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last foundhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easymatter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, andthe high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weigheddown with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought himnearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them foodfor the remainder of their journey.He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had leftthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffswhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his hearthe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud hallooas a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silentravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Againhe shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back fromthe friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, namelessdread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping theprecious food in his agitation.When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where thefire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The samedead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed toconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near theremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was onlytoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred duringhis absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left notraces behind it.Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spinround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. Hewas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered fromhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from thesmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its helpto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feetof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtakenthe fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they hadafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both ofhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himselfthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which madeevery nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side ofthe camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredlynot been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but anewly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that astick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleftfork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:                        JOHN FERRIER,                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]                    Died August 4th, 1860.The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,then, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly roundto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucyhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her originaldestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son. As the youngfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness toprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in hislast silent resting-place.Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springsfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at leastdevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, whichhe may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As hestood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which couldassuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, broughtby his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energyshould, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, whiteface, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and havingstirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for afew days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, heset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of theavenging angels.For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which hehad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down amongthe rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he wasalways well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Cañon,from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he couldlook down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leanedupon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silentwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed thatthere were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs offestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when heheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towardshim. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, towhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accostedhim when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what LucyFerrier’s fate had been.“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”The Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it wasdifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastlywhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of formerdays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,the man’s surprise changed to consternation.“You are mad to come here,” he cried. “It is as much as my own life isworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you fromthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.”“I don’t fear them, or their warrant,” Hope said, earnestly. “You mustknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything youhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. ForGod’s sake, don’t refuse to answer me.”“What is it?” the Mormon asked uneasily. “Be quick. The very rocks haveears and the trees eyes.”“What has become of Lucy Ferrier?”“She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, youhave no life left in you.”“Don’t mind me,” said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, andhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. “Married,you say?”“Married yesterday--that’s what those flags are for on the EndowmentHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangersonas to which was to have her. They’d both been in the party that followedthem, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him thebest claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber’s party wasthe stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won’t haveher very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is morelike a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?”“Yes, I am off,” said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. Hisface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was itsexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.“Where are you going?”“Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains tothe haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierceand so dangerous as himself.The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it wasthe terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriageinto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who hadmarried her principally for the sake of John Ferrier’s property, did notaffect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mournedover her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is theMormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours ofthe morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment,the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man intattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word tothe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which hadonce contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, hepressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatchingup her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. “She shall not beburied in that,” he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm couldbe raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so briefwas the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believeit themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for theundeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having beena bride had disappeared.For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leadinga strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire forvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weirdfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which hauntedthe lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson’swindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. Onanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great bouldercrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwinghimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long indiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and ledrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing orkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted theprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of havingtheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax thesemeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, andthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mindwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revengehad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room forany other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soonrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessantstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome foodwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, whatwas to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure toovertake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy’sgame, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there torecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue hisobject without privation.His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but acombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the minesfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory ofhis wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on thatmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier’s grave. Disguised,and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, carelesswhat became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew tobe justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been aschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the youngermembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of theElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of themalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had beenDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumourreported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of hisproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while hiscompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,however, as to their whereabouts.Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought ofrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope neverfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked outby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to townthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed intoyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a humanbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which hehad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It wasbut a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him thatCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. Hereturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance allarranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder inhis eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied byStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to himthat they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred ofan old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, andnot being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When atlast he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber’s house wasdeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatredurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, andfor some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for hisapproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life inhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city tocity, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking thefugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;and when he followed them there he learned that they had just set offfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, forthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in runningthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quotethe old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson’s Journal,to which we are already under such obligations.CHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.OUR prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate anyferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himselfpowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes thathe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. “I guess you’re going to takeme to the police-station,” he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. “My cab’s atthe door. If you’ll loose my legs I’ll walk down to it. I’m not so lightto lift as I used to be.”Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought thisproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner athis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles.[23] He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself thatthey were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyedhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his darksunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which wasas formidable as his personal strength.“If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon youare the man for it,” he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at myfellow-lodger. “The way you kept on my trail was a caution.”“You had better come with me,” said Holmes to the two detectives.“I can drive you,” said Lestrade.“Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you havetaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.”I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made noattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, andbrought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered intoa small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner’s nameand the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. Theofficial was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through hisduties in a dull mechanical way. “The prisoner will be put before themagistrates in the course of the week,” he said; “in the mean time, Mr.Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn youthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.”“I’ve got a good deal to say,” our prisoner said slowly. “I want to tellyou gentlemen all about it.”“Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?” asked the Inspector.“I may never be tried,” he answered. “You needn’t look startled. Itisn’t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?” He turned his fiercedark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.“Yes; I am,” I answered.“Then put your hand here,” he said, with a smile, motioning with hismanacled wrists towards his chest.I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing andcommotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed tothrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerfulengine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dullhumming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.“Why,” I cried, “you have an aortic aneurism!”“That’s what they call it,” he said, placidly. “I went to a Doctor lastweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many dayspassed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposureand under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve done my work now,and I don’t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some accountof the business behind me. I don’t want to be remembered as a commoncut-throat.”The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to theadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.“Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?” the formerasked, [24]“Most certainly there is,” I answered.“In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, totake his statement,” said the Inspector. “You are at liberty, sir, togive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.”“I’ll sit down, with your leave,” the prisoner said, suiting the actionto the word. “This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and thetussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brinkof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is theabsolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.”With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and beganthe following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodicalmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have hadaccess to Lestrade’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were takendown exactly as they were uttered.“It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; “it’senough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a fatherand a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their ownlives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it wasimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. Iknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, ifyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.“That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. Shewas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart overit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that hisdying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughtsshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carriedit about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over twocontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but theycould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowingthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.“They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me tofollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I foundthat I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and ridingare as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s office,and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to theowner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There wasseldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest jobwas to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that everwere contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside methough, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, Igot on pretty well.“It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. Theywere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of theriver. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. Ihad grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I wasdetermined that they should not escape me again.“They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would aboutLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on mycab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then theycould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or lateat night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind handwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could laymy hand upon the men I wanted.“They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there wassome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them everyday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk halfthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched themlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was notdiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. Myonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soonand leave my work undone.“At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as thestreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up totheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a timeDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horseand kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I fearedthat they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station theygot out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to theplatform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answerthat one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours.Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleasedthan otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hearevery word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a littlebusiness of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him hewould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and remindedhim that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that thematter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catchwhat Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, andreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that hemust not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it upas a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the lasttrain he should rejoin him at Halliday’s Private Hotel; to which Drebberanswered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and madehis way out of the station.“The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had myenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other,but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undueprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction invengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikeshim, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged bywhich I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged meunderstand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some daysbefore a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses inthe Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. Itwas claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I hadtaken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means ofthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I couldrely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that housewas the difficult problem which I had now to solve.“He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, stayingfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out hestaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was ahansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so closethat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way.We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until,to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which hehad boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returningthere; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so fromthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass ofwater, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.”I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.“That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, ormore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside thehouse. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one ofwhom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seenbefore. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came tothe head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him halfacross the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at him; ‘I’llteach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I think he wouldhave thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered awaydown the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as thecorner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. ‘Drive meto Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.“When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy thatI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drovealong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I mighttake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lanehave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when hesolved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, andhe ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving wordthat I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, andwhen he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my ownhands.“Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would onlyhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myselfto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his lifeif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which Ihave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor andsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor waslecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid,as he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrowpoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instantdeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and whenthey were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairlygood dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, andeach pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen shouldeach have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill thatremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy thanfiring across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxesabout with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.“It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hardand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--soglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of yougentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twentylong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you wouldunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady mynerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing withexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucylooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as Isee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on eachside of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.“There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except thedripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebberall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’stime to get out,’ I said.“‘All right, cabby,’ said he.“I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a littletop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into thefront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and thedaughter were walking in front of us.“‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.“‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it toa wax candle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, Enoch Drebber,’ Icontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who amI?’“He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then Isaw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, whichshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and Isaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chatteredin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughedloud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but Ihad never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.“‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderingshave come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow’s sunrise.’ He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on hisface that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in mytemples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fitof some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.“‘What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?’ I cried, locking the door, andshaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming, but ithas overtaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. Hewould have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.“‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.“‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog?What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from herslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shamelessharem.’“‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.“‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrustingthe box before him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose andeat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what youleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruledby chance.’“He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew myknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowedthe other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute ormore, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall Iever forget the look which came over his face when the first warningpangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I sawit, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but fora moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of paincontorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. Iturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. Therewas no movement. He was dead!“The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice ofit. I don’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon thewall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the policeupon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembereda German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and itwas argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies musthave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzlethe Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it ona convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and foundthat there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. Ihad driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in whichI usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found that it was not there. I wasthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her.Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber’sbody, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldlyup to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than losethe ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of apolice-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm hissuspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.“That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then wasto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier’s debt. I knewthat he was staying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about allday, but he never came out. [26] fancy that he suspected something whenDrebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson,and always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by stayingindoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the windowof his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladderswhich were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way intohis room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that thehour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so longbefore. I described Drebber’s death to him, and I gave him the samechoice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance ofsafety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at mythroat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have beenthe same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guiltyhand to pick out anything but the poison.“I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up.I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until Icould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in theyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there calledJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B,Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing Iknew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatlysnackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my story,gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I amjust as much an officer of justice as you are.”So thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was soimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professionaldetectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared tobe keenly interested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat forsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratchingof Lestrade’s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthandaccount.“There is only one point on which I should like a little moreinformation,” Sherlock Holmes said at last. “Who was your accomplice whocame for the ring which I advertised?”The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. “I can tell my own secrets,” he said, “but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw youradvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be thering which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you’llown he did it smartly.”“Not a doubt of that,” said Holmes heartily.“Now, gentlemen,” the Inspector remarked gravely, “the forms of the lawmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought beforethe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I willbe responsible for him.” He rang the bell as he spoke, and JeffersonHope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made ourway out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION.WE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon theThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for ourtestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and JeffersonHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice wouldbe meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurismburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of thecell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been ablein his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work welldone.“Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,” Holmes remarked, aswe chatted it over next evening. “Where will their grand advertisementbe now?”“I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,” Ianswered.“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,” returned mycompanion, bitterly. “The question is, what can you make people believethat you have done. Never mind,” he continued, more brightly, after apause. “I would not have missed the investigation for anything. Therehas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, therewere several most instructive points about it.”“Simple!” I ejaculated.“Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,” said SherlockHolmes, smiling at my surprise. “The proof of its intrinsic simplicityis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was ableto lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.”“That is true,” said I.“I have already explained to you that what is out of the common isusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of thissort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a veryuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practiseit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reasonforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty whocan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.”“I confess,” said I, “that I do not quite follow you.”“I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell youwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in theirminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There arefew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able toevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which ledup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoningbackwards, or analytically.”“I understand,” said I.“Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had tofind everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you thedifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approachedthe house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from allimpressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as Ihave already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which,I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. Isatisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by thenarrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerablyless wide than a gentleman’s brougham.“This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the gardenpath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitablefor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a meretrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon itssurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science whichis so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practicehas made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of theconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passedthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before theothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated bythe others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link wasformed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number,one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of hisstride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small andelegant impression left by his boots.“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-bootedman lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murderthere was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but theagitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen hisfate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or anysudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon theirfeatures. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a slightly soursmell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced uponhim. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatredand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I hadarrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcibleadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals.The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, willoccur at once to any toxicologist.“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had notbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Politicalassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murderhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetratorhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been thereall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a politicalone, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscriptionwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to myopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it toremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this pointthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram toCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former career. Heanswered, you remember, in the negative.“I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, whichconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished mewith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the lengthof his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were nosigns of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burstfrom the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that thetrack of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom thatany man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way throughemotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably arobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.“Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. Itelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiryto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. Theanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied forthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named JeffersonHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now thatI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was tosecure the murderer.“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walkedinto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driventhe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wanderedon in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone incharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were insidethe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carryout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a thirdperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wishedto dog another through London, what better means could he adopt thanto turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistibleconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of theMetropolis.“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased tobe. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would belikely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time atleast, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to supposethat he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his namein a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organizedmy Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to everycab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, arestill fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was anincident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly inany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came intopossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a breakor flaw.”“It is wonderful!” I cried. “Your merits should be publicly recognized.You should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will foryou.”“You may do what you like, Doctor,” he answered. “See here!” hecontinued, handing a paper over to me, “look at this!”It was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed wasdevoted to the case in question.“The public,” it said, “have lost a sensational treat through the suddendeath of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. EnochDrebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case willprobably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authoritythat the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, inwhich love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victimsbelonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, thedeceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has hadno other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking mannerthe efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lessonto all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds athome, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secretthat the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-knownScotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.
